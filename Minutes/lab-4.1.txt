### Apologies: 

### Meeting Purpose: Combining Individual Modules (Integration)

### Previous Actions: Update on Individual Modules

### Current Items:
Max - 3D printing, scoreboard, main C code
Marco - flex potentiometer
Tom - LDR sensor
Nadeesha - LIDAR distance measurement

### New Items:
#### 3D printing: Ramp is currently being printed, and will be picked up tomorrow for our next meeting
#### Scoreboard: The serial output to the scoreboard is now implemented using a packet of information. This needs to be fully implemented, and also needs some aesthetic polish. 
#### LIDAR: getDistance and setDistance functions are now implemented and working. Someone in the group will bring in a piece of cardboard which will go behind the backboard to ensure the sensor acquires an accurate measurement. 
#### LDR: Tom has function which uses polling approach, and is working on a function that will output whether the ball is on the stand or not (as a Boolean). 
#### Flex Potentiometer: Flex sensor module is implemented. 
#### Main C code: Standard game mode has been programmed. Other game modes to be completed before next meeting. 

### Next Meeting Date: 21/05/2024
